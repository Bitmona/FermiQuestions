                <div class="content">
                    This site has taken a tremendous amount of time to build,
                    perfect, and maintain. The question bank alone took me several
                    days of manually scraping the internet and verifying the
                    answers. If you use this site, I would greatly appreciate any
                    support you can offer. This helps motivate me to continue
                    working on this project, and helps me justify the amount of time
                    I spend on it!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Because I know firsthand that students rarely have spare money
                    to donate, I have a variety of other ways you could help support
                    me. Consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Starring this project on Github so it looks good to
                            potential employers

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sending me a supportive email at: eric (at) andrechek
                            (dot) com
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Turning off your adblocker on this site to help it make some passive revenue
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Helping add to the question bank or adding features to
                            the website via the Github page
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sending me money through one of the following methods so
                            I can go into marginally less college debt:
                            <ul>

                <div class="subtitle">About this site</div>
                <div class="content">
                    This website was written by me,
                    <a href="https://github.com/EricAndrechek">Eric Andrechek</a>.
                    When I was a high school student participating in Science
                    Olympiad, I found that every week a new fermi questions website
                    had popped up, and an old one had gone down. After growing
                    frustrated with never finding an easy-on-the-eyes, functional,
                    reliable, online practice test, I set out to make my own.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This website was built in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It
                    uses a CSS library called Bulma, to help make it look pretty
                    with as little work as possible. It also uses a JavaScript
                    library called Darkmode-JS, to make the website dark mode
                    compatible and allow you to switch between dark and light
                    themes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The goal behind this simple website is to make it as reliable
                    and stable as possible. While some of the features require a
                    more modern browser, the idea is that the entire website can
                    function without a server. This means that, thanks to Github
                    Pages, there are no hosting costs, so this website should be
                    around and available for a very long time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Finally, after building an earlier version of this website, I
                    have decided to open source this one. I want to be able to allow
                    students using the site to fix any bugs they might notice. Open
                    sourcing the site, and question bank, also means that anyone can
                    download all the questions and answers, and can even help
                    contribute to the site by adding more.
